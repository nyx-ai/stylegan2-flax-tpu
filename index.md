## This Food Does Not Exist 🍪🍰🍣🍹🍔

**We have trained StyleGAN2 models to generate food pictures. The images below are all purely synthetic!**

## Multi-class 512x512 model (v0.2, October 2022) 🆕

We are releasing a new and much improved model:

- Single 5-class model (burger/cheesecake/cocktail/cookie/sushi) instead of multiple 1-class models
- Resolution of 512x512 instead of 256x256
- Trained for much longer: 8 days at 256x256 then 28 days at 512x512 instead of 10 hours
- Trained on more data: 558k 512x512 images instead of 100k 256x256 images

## Single-class 256x256 models (v0.1, July 2022)

*The models below were released in July 2022. Each model was trained on a single food class: cookie, cheescake, cocktail and sushi. 
They can still be used with the v0.2 code.*

## Why not DALL·E/diffusion models? 🤔

Recent methods like diffusion and auto-regressive models are all the rage these days: [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), [Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com/) (formerly DALL·E mini), [ruDALL-E](https://rudalle.ru/en/)... Why not go in this direction?

### Realism vs control

StyleGAN models shine in terms of photorealism, as can be some by some of our food results. For another example, the website [ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) produces very believable face images. While GANs are still better at this, [diffusion models are catching up](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233) and this may change soon.

Diffusion models offer better control and flexibility, thanks in large part to text guidance. This comes at the cost of larger models and slower generation times.

### Training resources

We were able to train the provided models in less than 10h each using a single TPU v4-8:

![Training plots](static/fid_pretrained.png)

[FID (Fréchet inception distance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_inception_distance) is a metric used to assess the quality of images created by a generative model.

In comparison, Craiyon is being training on a v3-256 TPU pod which means 32x the resources (albeit using the previous TPU generation) and the training [has been going on for over a month](https://wandb.ai/dalle-mini/dalle-mini/reports/DALL-E-Mega-Training-Journal--VmlldzoxODMxMDI2).

### Result comparison

No cherry-picking!
